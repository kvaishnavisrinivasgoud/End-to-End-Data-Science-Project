# End-to-End-Data-Science-Project
## Full Data Science Project: From Data Collection to Model Deployment
In this project, we will develop a complete data science pipeline, starting from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment using Flask or FastAPI. The final deliverable will be a deployed API or web app showcasing the model's functionality.

## Project Overview
We will build a House Price Prediction model using a dataset containing features of houses (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.) and their corresponding prices. The model will be deployed as an API using Flask or FastAPI, allowing users to input house features and receive a predicted price.
# Step 1: Data Collection
We will use the California Housing Dataset from the sklearn.datasets module or a similar dataset from Kaggle (e.g., Kaggle House Prices Dataset).
