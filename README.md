# End-to-End-Data-Science-Project
## Full Data Science Project: From Data Collection to Model Deployment
In this project, we will develop a complete data science pipeline, starting from data collection and preprocessing to model training and deployment using Flask or FastAPI. The final deliverable will be a deployed API or web app showcasing the model's functionality.

## Project Overview
We will build a House Price Prediction model using a dataset containing features of houses (e.g., square footage, number of bedrooms, location, etc.) and their corresponding prices. The model will be deployed as an API using Flask or FastAPI, allowing users to input house features and receive a predicted price.
Step 1: Data Collection
We will use the California Housing Dataset from the sklearn.datasets module or a similar dataset from Kaggle (e.g., Kaggle House Prices Dataset).

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Handle Missing Values: Check for missing values and handle them (e.g., imputation or removal).

Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones (e.g., log transformation for skewed data).

Encoding Categorical Variables: Use one-hot encoding or label encoding for categorical features.

Scaling/Normalization: Scale numerical features to a standard range.

Step 3: Model Training
We will use a Linear Regression model for simplicity, but you can experiment with more advanced models like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Neural Networks.

Step 4: Save the Model
Save the trained model and scaler using joblib or pickle for later use in the API.

Step 5: Build the API with Flask
We will use Flask to create a simple API that accepts house features as input and returns the predicted price.

1.Install Flask:
                      
                         pip install flask
2.Create a Flask app:

3.Run the Flask app:

                         python app.py

4.Test the API using curl or Postman:

                      curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"features": [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]}' http://127.0.0.1:5000/predict

Step 6: Deploy the API
You can deploy the Flask app using platforms like:
-Heroku
-AWS Elastic Beanstalk
-Google Cloud Run
-Render

For example, to deploy on Heroku:
1.Install the Heroku CLI and login.
2.Create a Procfile:

               web: python app.py

3.Push your code to Heroku:
                    heroku create
                    git push heroku main
